BEDFORD
     Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
     Comets, importing change of times and states,
     Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
     And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
     That have consented unto Henry's death!
     King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
     England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
GLOUCESTER
     England ne'er had a king until his time.
     Virtue he had, deserving to command:
     His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
     His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
     His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
     More dazzled and drove back his enemies
     Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
     What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
     He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
