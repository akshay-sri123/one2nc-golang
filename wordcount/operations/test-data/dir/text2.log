An array is a collection of elements of the same data type. A struct array is an array that contains elements of the struct type. An example of a struct array is as follows
To group the struct array by a particular field, we can use a map data structure in Go. A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. In our case, the key will be the value of the field we want to group the struct array by, and the value will be an array of the structs that have that value for the specified field.
Once we have grouped the struct array, we can list the grouped elements with key-value pairs. To do this, we can iterate through the map and print out each key-value pair, where the key is the group field and the value is the array of structs that belong to that group. Hereâ€™s an example.
